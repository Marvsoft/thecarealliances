                        <p>In 1999 Mr. Lovings entered into the publishing industry as an Account
                            Executive with Upscale Magazine where he managed six (6) states comprised of Advertising
                            Agencies and Corporations; as well as successfully managing a number of ad placements and
                            co-branded marketing programs.


                            With the decline in the advertising business after the devastation of September 11th , Mr.
                            Lovings made the decision to begin his own company in 2003 making him the CEO and Founder of
                            Core Consulting and Marketing Group (CCMG), bringing with him an impressive list of contact
                            and clients such as Gallo Winery, Moet Hennessy, Jack Daniels, General Motors,
                            Lincoln-Mercury, Images USA and Black Entertainment Television (BET). Being the driving
                            force behind the development of CCMG’s objectives,
                            policies, and initiatives for short and long term goals; Mr. Lovings also handles the role
                            of General Manager for one of his clients, Uptown Magazine for Metro Atlanta, directing

                            Clayton County School System which enables him to stay connected with our community’s most
                            precious commodity, our children,
                            staying current with their thoughts and ideas in order to effectively guide and mentor. One
                            of the ways he carries this out is by his own personal style and promoting the importance of
                            a professional image. As the winner of the
                            2006 Best Dressed Man in American for Esquire Magazine, Mr. Lovings uses this accomplishment
                            as a tool to guide young adults to recognize that style does matter in a business
                            environment.
